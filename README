HOW TO BUILD

Please ensure that you have Yocto Krogoth SDK for styl-image-yellowfin*.
Please contact STYL's system engineers for more detailed information.

# Initialize development environment
source <location of extracted SDK>/poky/2.1.1/environment-setup-cortexa9hf-neon-poky-linux-gnueabi

# Generate autoconf file
./autogen.sh

# Configure package
./configure --host=arm-poky-linux-gnueabi --prefix=${PWD}/image
make -j4

EXAMPLES

stylagps_demo (source example/main.c):

	An infinite loop runs to queries AGPS location via libstylagps API.
	Output result to stdout.
	Terminate process by hitting Ctrl-C

stylagps_send (source example/stylAgpsSend.c):

	Query AGPS location data and write to file to share with other processes.
	IPC Concept: Write then wait until file is deleted by receiver.

	An infinite loop runs to queries AGPS location via libstylagps API.
	Output result to stdout with prefix "SEND".
	Write data to AGPS_DATA_FILE (default is /tmp/stylagps.data).
	To avoid race condition, AGPS_DATA_FILE is not updated until it deleted by reader.
	Terminate process by hitting Ctrl-C


stylagps_receive (source example/stylAgpsReceive.c):

	Receive AGPS location from AGPS_DATA_FILE which is feeded by stylagps_send.
	IPC Concept: Read then delete to allow sender to update.

	An infinite loop runs to queries AGPS location via libstylagps API.
	Output result to stdout with prefix "RECEIVE".
	Read data from AGPS_DATA_FILE (default is /tmp/stylagps.data).
	To avoid race condition, AGPS_DATA_FILE is deleted after reading to allow sender do update.
	Terminate process by hitting Ctrl-C
